## The Problem
- Retail media creatives are complex and compliance-heavy (Tesco, Sainsbury's, etc.).
- Designers spend hours manually checking safe zones, contrast, and guidelines.
- Mistakes lead to rejection and wasted time.

- **Features**:
  - Auto-layout generation based on canvas size.
  - Real-time compliance checking (Safe zones, Forbidden copy).
  - Background removal and optimization.
